 * @brief Dynamic set data structure utilities for vertex collections
 * @author Graph Theory Project Team
 * @date 2024
 * 
 * This module provides a simple dynamic set implementation for storing
 * collections of vertex indices. The set is implemented as a dynamic array
 * with automatic capacity management.
 * 
 * The set structure is used extensively throughout the graph algorithms
 * for storing:
 * - Clique vertices in clique detection algorithms
 * - Independent set vertices
 * - Vertex cover sets
 * - Candidate and excluded sets in recursive algorithms
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Dynamic resizing (manual management)
 * - Simple add/remove operations
 * - Memory management utilities
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(1) for basic operations
 * Space Complexity: O(capacity) where capacity â‰¥ size
